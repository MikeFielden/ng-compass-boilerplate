This repo is based off the popular [ng-boilerplate](https://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate) 
An opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

Install compass
  http://compass-style.org/install/
  ```sh
  $ gem update --system
  $ gem install compass
  ```

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:MikeFielden/ng-compass-boilerplate.git
$ cd ng-compass-boilerplate
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

## Purpose

`ngCompassBoilerplate` is designed to make life easy by providing a basic framework
with which to kickstart AngularJS projects. It contains a best-practice
directory structure to ensure code reusability and maximum scalability.
ngCompassBoilerplate also comes prepackaged with the most popular design frameworks
around: 
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
[UIBootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap)
[Compass](http://compass-stype.org).  
Lastly, it contains a sophisticated Grunt-based build system to ensure maximum productivity.  All you have to do is clone it and start coding!

## Philosophy

The principal goal of `ngCompassBoilerplate` is to set projects up for long-term
success.  So `ngCompassBoilerplate` tries to follow best practices everywhere it can.
These are:

- Properly orchestrated modules to encourage drag-and-drop component re-use.
- Tests exist alongside the component they are testing, no separate `test`
  directory required. The build process should be sophisticated enough to handle
  this.
- Speaking of which, the build system should work automagically, without
  involvement from the developer. It should do what needs to be done, while
  staying out of the way.  Components should end up tested, linted, compiled,
  and minified, ready for use in a production environment.
- Integration with popular tools (Bower only for now, hopefully others in the
  future).
- *Engourages* test-driven development. It's the only way to code.
- A directory structure that is cogent, meaningful to new team members, and
  supporting of the above points.
- Well-documented, to show new developers *why* things are set up the way they
  are.
- It should be responsive to evidence. Community feedback is therefore crucial
  to the success of `ngCompassBoilerplate`.

But `ngCompassBoilerplate` is not an example of an AngularJS app: this is a
kickstarter. If you're looking for an example of what a complete, non-trivial
AngularJS app that does something real looks like, complete with a REST backend
and authentication and authorization, then take a look at
[`angular-app`](http://github.com/angular-app/angular-app), which does just
that - and does it well.

### Overall Directory Structure

At a high level, the structure looks roughly like this:

```
ng-boilerplate/
  |- build/
  |  |- angular/
  |- grunt-tasks/
  |- karma/
  |- src/
  |  |- app/
  |  |  |- <app logic>
  |  |- assets/
  |  |  |- <static files>
  |  |- components/
  |  |  |- <reusable code & external libs>
  |  |- sass/
  |  |  |- main.scss
  |- vendor/
  |  |- angular-bootstrap/
  |  |- bootstrap/
  |  |- placeholders/
  |- Gruntfile.js
  |- module.prefix
  |- module.suffix
  |- package.json
```


What follows is a brief description of each entry, but all directories contain
their own `README.md` file with additional documentation, so browse around to
learn more.

- `build/` - files needed to make everything happen, but *not* libraries our
  application uses. [Read more &raquo;](build/README.md)
- `grunt-tasks/` - custom scripts for Grunt.
- `karma` - test configuration.
- `src/` - our application sources. [Read more &raquo;](src/README.md)
- `vendor/` - third-party libraries. [Bower](http://bower.io) will install
  packages here. Anything added to this directory will need to be manually added
  to `Gruntfile.js` and `karma/karma-unit.js` to be picked up by the build
  system.
- `.bowerrc` - the Bower configuration file. This tells Bower to install
  components into the `vendor/` directory.
- `bower.js` - this is our project configuration for Bower and it contains the
  list of Bower dependencies we need.
- `Gruntfile.js` - our build script; see "The Build System" below.
- `module.prefix` and `module.suffix` - our compiled application script is
  wrapped in these, which by default are used to place the application inside a
  self-executing anonymous function to ensure no clashes with other libraries.
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our
  NPM dependencies are listed here.

### Detailed Installation

`ngCompassBoilerplate` uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.org) as its build system, so
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is required. Also, Grunt by default no longer comes
with a command-line utility and Karma and Bower must end up in your global path
for the build system to find it, so they must be installed independently. Once
you have Node.js installed, you can simply use `npm` to make it all happen:

```sh
$ npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
```

If you're on Linux (like I am) then throw `sudo` in front of that command.  If
you're on Windows, you're on your own.

Next, you can either clone this repository using Git, download it as a zip file
from GitHub, or merge the branch into your existing repository. Assuming you're
starting from scratch, simply clone this repository using git:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:MikeFielden/ng-compass-boilerplate.git my-project-name
$ cd my-project-name
```

And then install the remaining build dependencies locally:

```sh
$ npm install
```

This will read the `dependencies` (empty by default) and the `devDependencies`
(which contains our build requirements) from `package.json` and install
everything needed into a folder called `node_modules/`.

Twitter Bootstrap and AngularUI Bootstrap are Bower packages listed in
`bower.js`. Since they are already listed, simply run this to install them into
the `vendor/` directory:

```sh
$ bower install
```

In the future, should you want to add a new Bower package to your app, run the
`install` command:

```sh
$ bower install package-name --save-dev
```

The `--save-dev` flag tells Bower to add the package at its current version to
our project's `bower.js` file so should another developer download our
application (or we download it from a different computer), we can simply run the
`bower install` command as above and all our dependencies will be installed for
us. Neat!

Technically, `ngCompassBoilerplate` is now ready to go.

However, prior to hacking on your application, you will want to modify the
`package.json` file to contain your project's information. Do not remove any
items from the `devDependencies` array as all are needed for the build process
to work.

To ensure your setup works, launch grunt:

```sh
$ grunt watch
```

The built files are placed in the `dist/` directory.  Open the `dist/index.html`
file in your browser. Because everything is compiled, no XHR requests are needed
to retrieve templates, so until this needs to communicate with your backend,
there is no need to run it from a web server.

`watch` is actually an alias of the `grunt-contrib-watch` that will first run
the entire build before watching for file changes. With this setup, any file
that changes will trigger only those build tasks necessary to bring the app up
to date. For example, when a template file changes, the templates are recompiled
and concatenated with the rest of the JavaScript files, but when a test/spec
file changes, only the tests are run. This allows the watch command to complete
in a fraction of the time it would ordinarily take.

In addition, if you're running a Live Reload plugin in your browser (see below),
you won't even have to refresh to see the changes! When the `watch` task detects
a file change, it will reload the page for you. Sweet.

However, a complete build is always available by simply running the default
task:

```sh
$ grunt
```

### The Build System

The best way to learn about the build system is by familiarizing yourself with
Grunt and then reading through the heavily documented build script,
`Gruntfile.js`. But what follows in this section is a quick introduction to the
tasks provided.

The driver of the process is the `delta` multi-task, which watches for file
changes using `grunt-contrib-watch` and executes one of seven tasks when a file
changes:

* `delta:gruntfile` - When `Gruntfile.js` changes, this task runs the linter
  (`jshint`) on that one file.
* `delta:assets` - When any file within `src/assets/` changes, all asset files
  are copied to `dist/assets/`.
* `delta:html` - When `src/index.html`, it is compiled as a Grunt template, so
  script names, etc., are dynamically replaced with the correct values from
  `package.json`.
* `delta:sass` - When any `*.scss` file within `src/` changes, the
  `src/sass/main.scss` file is linted, compiled, and compressed into
  `dist/assets/ng-boilerplate.css`.
* `delta:src` - When any JavaScript file within `src/` that does not end in
  `.spec.js` changes, all JavaScript sources are linted, all unit tests are run,
  and the previously-compiled templates are concatenated with them to form the
  final JavaScript source file (`dist/assets/ng-boilerplate.js`).
* `delta:tpls` - When any `*.tpl.html` file within `src/` changes, all templates
  are put into strings in a JavaScript file (technically two, one for
  `src/components/` and another for `src/app/`) that will add the template to
  AngularJS's
  [`$templateCache`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$templateCache) so
  template files are part of the initial JavaScript payload and do not require
  any future XHR.  The template cache files are then concatenated with the rest
  of the scripts into the final JavaScript source file
  (`dist/assets/ng-boilerplate.js`).
* `delta:unittest` - When any `*.spec.js` file in `src/` changes, the test files
  are linted and the unit tests are executed.

As covered in the previous section, `grunt watch` will execute a full build
up-front and then run any of the aforementioned `delta:*` tasks as needed to
ensure the fastest possible build.

### Live Reload!

`ngCompassBoilerplate` now includes [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/), so you no
longer have to refresh your page after making changes! You need a Live Reload
browser plugin for this:

- Chrome - [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
- Firefox - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.8/LiveReload-2.0.8.xpi)
- Safari - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.9/LiveReload-2.0.9.safariextz)
- Internet Explorer - Surely you jest.

Note that if you're using the Chrome version with `file://` URLs (as is the
default with `ngCompassBoilerplate`) you need to tell Live Reload to allow it. Go to
`Menu -> Tools -> Extensions` and check the "Allow access to file URLs" box.

When you load your page, click the Live Reload icon in your toolbar and
everything should work magically. w00t!

If you'd prefer to not install a browser extension, then you must add the
following to the end of your `body` tag in `index.html`:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
```
